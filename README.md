# uber-app

Hello! This is an exploratory repository for my own personal use to explore the Uber Developers API.

## Privacy policsy
There will be no saving of any data sent or received into any sort of database, nor will there be any caching, looking to build a simple tool
that only has a few screens where I am able to log into my account and request a ride, given that I manually input the pickup and destination
addresses. This application will only be used by me to request rides through Uber through a static web API, so that I can call ubers while still
using my flip phone.
